Release Notes for Simple Linux Backup
-------------------------------------

0.3.3
=====
Development release for the 0.4 public release. Note that this release may be unstable,
as it is still in development.

Changes:
- Simple Linux Backup now tracks when the last full backup was performed for each backup
  set, and performs a full backup whenever the previous one occurred more than 7 days
  ago.
- A new x86 64-bit version is available.
- Fixed a problem in the Simple Backup Configuration Program (SBCP) startup script,
  simplebackupconfig. The script sometimes did not correctly determine the real
  directory in which it was running, causing failures in starting SBCP.

0.3.2
=====
Development release for the 0.4 public release. Note that this release may be unstable,
as it is still in development.

Changes:
- Running Simple Backup Configuration Program now tests for the correct version of
  Java. If the reported Java version is less than 1.5, the user sees an error message
  and SBCP doesn't run.
- The latest versions of Eclipse SWT are now included.
- Minor changes were made to clarify certain text in a few dialog boxes.
- Note that the Turkish translation has NOT been updated. As a result, the above dialog box
  message clarifications do not appear in the Turkish version, and a couple of messages
  show up in English rather than Turkish.
- Internationalization support has been enhanced -- the standard wizard page buttons Back,
  Next, Finish and Cancel now appear in the user's selected language. Note that currently
  supported languages are English, French and Turkish.

0.3.1
=====
Development release for the 0.4 public release. Note that this release may be unstable,
as it is still in development.

Changes:
- Backup and Exclude lists are now kept in sorted order on the Files to Backup dialog.
- Fix to incremental backups on mounted filesystems such as SMB (Windows shares) and
  NFS. Incremental backups now use tar's "--newer" option along with a timestamp
  file, rather than using tar's "--listed-incremental" option, which didn't work with
  mounted filesystems.
- Backups now produce an "index file", using tar's "--index-file" option. This is
  in preparation for introduction of a program to help users restore files from
  a backup.

0.3.0
=====
Development release for the 0.4 public release. Note that this release may be unstable,
as it is still in development.

Changes:
- A new button on the Advanced Options Page schedules the backup for the user, by asking
  for a backup time and adding an entry to the appropriate user's crontab. If the "cron"
  daemon is running, this will cause the backup script to run at the user-selected time.
- Internationalization: Moved all displayed strings to external property files that can be
  translated into other languages.
- Advanced Options page now lists the exact command to be added to the crontab to execute
  the backup script. It now takes into account the directory where simplelinuxbkup is
  installed.
- New About dialog also lists contributors to the project.
- Use Java properties for home directory, path separator.
